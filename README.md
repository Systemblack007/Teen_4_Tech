# Teens_4_Tech


This project is part of my archievments as a teenager and it is aimed at connecting 
Teenagers who want to venture into tech as a career and Teenaagers who are already doing well in it, most especially Teenagers from Africa, so as to encourage them, teach them, and also learn from them as a teenager.

People say I'm good at what I do but I know that that if I wasn't opportuned to start from a young age I might have even lost intrest in the tech stuff, Thats why i want to pass on the same encouragement and support to other teenagers out there who may be feeling discouraged about their little or no progress in chasing their dreams.

If a teenager is competent in software development he/she can also get hired and earn some money so he could start learning how to be the next big developer in the industry.
